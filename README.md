# Filmetrics: Movie Rating and Box Office Prediction

Filmetrics is a comprehensive project focused on predicting movie ratings and box office collections based on movie metadata. Leveraging machine learning techniques and extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project provides insights into the factors influencing movie success and quality.

## Overview

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Dataset:** The project utilizes diverse movie datasets comprising metadata, including features like genres, cast, crew, budget, runtime, release date, and more.
- **EDA:** Extensive data exploration is performed, visualizing relationships, distributions, and trends within the movie metadata through various graphs and charts.

### Prediction Models

- **Machine Learning Models:**  machine learning algorithm like "*RandomForestRegressor*" are employed to predict movie ratings and box office collections.
- **Prediction:** Using python libraries statistical analysis and prediction is done to compare the values.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation:** Scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Python notebooks containing EDA visualizations and analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Python libraries and math used to analyse the metadata and calculate predicted rating  
- **Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning model for rating and box office prediction.
